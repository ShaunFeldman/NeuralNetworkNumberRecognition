This Neural Network project is trained off of a dataset of 60,000 images.
It can with a 97% accuracy detect the handwritten digit given to it from 0-9 inclusive.
It was created and trained 3 different times.
Once with an epoch of 3 times
Once with an epoch of 10 times
Once with an epoch of 30 times
Obviously the 30 times is the most accurate model but for the projects sake 3 times works just as well
Visual data graphs are saved to view of the accuracy and loss of the model for all the types of epochs
